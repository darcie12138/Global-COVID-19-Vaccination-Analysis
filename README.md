# Analysis and Visualization of Global COVID-19 Vaccination

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing global COVID-19 vaccination data to uncover trends and correlations. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization of key vaccination metrics across countries and regions.

## Overview

The project aims to provide insights into global COVID-19 vaccination progress and its relationship with economic indicators such as GDP. It features an interactive dashboard published on Tableau Public for users to explore various vaccination metrics.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Exploration**:
  - Cleaned and manipulated vaccination data using Python and Pandas.
  - Explored trends and correlations between vaccination rates and GDP across countries and regions.
- **Visualization**:
  - Created static visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight trends and patterns.
  - Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard with features like:
    - Bar charts for comparative analysis.
    - Maps for geographic distribution of vaccination data.
    - Line charts for time-series trends of daily, total, and full vaccinations.

## Interactive Dashboard
The interactive dashboard is available on Tableau Public:
